# passion for home automation? look here

in this guide we will explain in a simple way how to have a safe and fun home automation management.

requirements: [home assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and [node red](https://nodered.org/)

# step 1: type of installation of home assistant

our advice is to keep the "hot" spots separate. many times tap restart home assistant (example a new sensor in configuration.yaml) and our home automation is out of 

order; in my case i installed home assistant in a [raspberry p4 +](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/), but you can install home assitant with 

[proxmox os]() o [hyper V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/hyper-v-technology-overview). read [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/installation/) for more information 

# step 2: node red

Install node red not as an addon, but as a separate installation from home assistant. you can install it in [windows](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/windows), 

if you have a mini pc, or with [proxmox]()
